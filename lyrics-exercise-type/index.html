  <p>Once I had a love and it was divine</p>
  <p> Soon found out I was losing my mind</P>
  <P>It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind</P> 
 <P>  Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind</p>
</section>

<section>
  <p>In between, what I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine </p>
  <P>Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind</P>  
   <p>If I fear I'm losing you, it's just no good</p> 
    <p>You teasing like you do</p>
