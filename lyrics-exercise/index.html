<p>Once I had a love and it was a gas <p>
   <p>Soon turned out had a heart of glass</p> 
   <p>Seemed like the real thing, only to find</p> 
   <p> Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind</p>
                <br>
<p>Once I had a love and it was divine</p>
   <p> Soon found out I was losing my mind</P>
   <P>It seemed like the real thing but I was so blind</P> 
  <P>  Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind</p>
                <br>
<p>In between, what I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine </p>
  <P>Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind</P>  
   <p>If I fear I'm losing you, it's just no good</p> 
    <p>You teasing like you do</p>
                 <br>

    <p>Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind</p>
                 <br>
<p>Lost inside, adorable illusion and I cannot hide</p>
  <p>I'm the one you're using, please don't push me aside</p>  
  <p>  We could've made it cruising</p>
                  <br>
 <p>Riding high on love's true bluish light</p>
                 <br>
 <p>Once I had a love and it was a gas
   <p>Soon turned out to be a pain in the ass</p>
