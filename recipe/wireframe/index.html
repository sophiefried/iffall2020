    <h1>INGREDIENTS</h1>
    <p>1  cup (2 sticks) of unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for greasing pans</p>
    <p>1 ¼  cups all-purpose flour, plus extra for dusting pans</p>
    <p>1 ½  cups self-rising flour</p>
    <p>1  cup milk</p>
    <p>1  teaspoon vanilla extract</p>
    <p>2  cups sugar</p>

<h1>PREPARATION</h1>
<ul>
<h2>Step 1</h2>
<li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line two 12-cup muffin tins with cupcake papers. Mix the flours together in a bowl. In a glass measure, mix the milk and vanilla.</li>
<h2>Step 2</h2>
<li>In a large bowl, cream the butter with an electric mixer at medium speed until smooth. Add the sugar gradually and beat until fluffy (about 3 minutes). Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Gradually add the flour mixture, alternating with the milk and the vanilla, beating well after each addition. Spoon the batter into muffin cups about 3/4 full.</li>
<h2>Step 3</h2>
<li>Bake until the tops of the cupcakes spring back when lightly touched, 20 to 22 minutes. Remove cupcakes from the pans and cool on a rack before icing.</li>
</ul>
